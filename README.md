- 👋 Hi, I’m @somuchmoh
- 👀 I’m currently on an adventure to teach myself coding... from SCRATCH!!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with the #100DaysOfCoding challenge as step 1 in the journey
- 💞️ The end goal is to create and monetize something of my own - maybe a blog? or something in e-commerce.
- 📝 I have documented all my learnings and lessons [here]([url](https://somuchmoh.notion.site/a45b977b78cc4d3dbbfc65b047a5f74d?v=4a811d914f65476d940ec326d0f4fb56&pvs=4)).
